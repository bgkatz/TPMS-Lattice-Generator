# TPMS-Lattice-Generator
Tool for generating TPMS lattices for importing into parametric CAD
It's still not very good, but I (by which I mean Gemini) am working on it.

Currently can:
* Generate an STL triangle mesh or OBJ quad mesh of gyroid, I-WP, and Diamond TPMS lattice structures.
* export a zero-thickness sheet, two zero thickness sheets a specified thickness apart, or a water-tight volume of specified thickness
* preview the mesh export

In the gif below, a quad mesh was imported into Solidworks as a solid body.  It can be cut, booleaned, etc. with other solid operations.  It could also be imported as a surface body and used as a splitting suface or imported int Fusion and converted from a quad mesh to T-Spline mesh.
